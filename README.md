# Melbourne-Tourist-IOS

### My fist complex iOS Application implementation

### Location-aware application that serves as an aid for tourists interested in Melbourne City’s historical sights. 
### Users are able to view information on the various historical locations throughout Melbourne’s CBD that have locations associated with them. 
### Application provides notifications to the user when they enter the range of an attraction

- The application makes use of CoreData, CoreLocation, MapKit with custom MKAnnotations, Geofencing, Gecoding, UserNotifications, Protocol & Delegates;
- Custom Regex implementation for user input validation and ImagePickerController.
